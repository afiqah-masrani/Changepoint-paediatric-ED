Changepoint analysis of paediatric ED visits across the pre, during, and post COVID-19 lockdown periods in Malaysia

These are the codes used in the manuscript "THE CHANGING TREND OF PAEDIATRIC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS IN MALAYSIA FOLLOWING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC"

Abstract:

Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the emergency department (ED) due to the surge in medical demand and changes in the characteristics of paediatric visits. Additionally, the trend for paediatric ED visits has decreased globally, secondary to implementing lockdowns to stop the spread of COVID-19. We aim to study the trend and characteristics of paediatric ED visits following Malaysiaâ€™s primary timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods and materials: A five-year time series observational study of paediatric ED patients from two tertiary hospitals in Malaysia was conducted from March 17, 2017 (week 11 2017) to March 17, 2022 (week 12 2022). Aggregated weekly data were analysed using R statistical software version 4.2.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) against significant events 1during the COVID-19 pandemic to detect influential changepoints in the trend. The data collected were the number of ED visits, triage severity, visit outcomes and ED discharge diagnosis.

Results: Overall, 175,737 paediatric ED visits were recorded with a median age of three years and predominantly males (56.8%). A 57.57% (p<0.001) reduction in the average weekly ED visits was observed during the Movement Control Order (MCO) period. Despite the increase in the proportion of urgent (OR=1.23, p<0.001) and emergent or life-threatening (OR=1.79, p<0.001) cases, the proportion of admissions decreased. Whilst the changepoints during the MCO indicated a rise in respiratory, fever or other infectious diseases, or gastrointestinal conditions, diagnosis of complications originating from the perinatal period declined from July 19, 2021 (week 29 2021).

Conclusion: The incongruent change in disease severity and hospital admission reflects the potential effects of the healthcare system reform and socioeconomic impact as the pandemic evolves. Future studies on parental motivation to seek emergency medical attention may provide insight into the timing and choice of healthcare service utilisation.
